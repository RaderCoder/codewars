# codewars
Recently practicing codewars a lot and thought that people might like to see some of these solutions

Don't look at these if:
1. You haven't attempted to solve the problem
2. You are looking for an incredibly optimized solution

I am not that good so this code is more for reference if anything
I will add my solution and a more optimized solution
I'll try to explain through comments if something seems a little difficult
Finally, all the code will be in python3
For now I will not add any other languages
Eventually however I will use other languages for the solutions
